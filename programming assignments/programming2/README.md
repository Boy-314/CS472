# Instructions For Compiling and Running

1. ITERATIVE DEEPENING
2. Replace line 176 "input.txt" with your test file name
3. To compile Iterative Deepining algorithm, execute `g++ -std=c++11 Knapsack-ID.cc -o Knapsack-ID`
4. Run with `./Knapsack-ID.exe`
5. NOTE TO THE GRADER: This program does not work 100%. Final output is buggy. I went to Professor Davis during office hours to try and fix the solution, but both of us could not figure out what went wrong. I have left the print statementsn inside the DFS method to show that indeed, the program finds the correct solution, but somehow when outputting there is some sort of error.

1. HILL CLIMBING
2. To compile Hill Climbing with random restarts algorithm, execute `g++ -std=c++11 Knapsack-HC.cc -o Knapsack-HC`
3. Run with `./Knapsack-HC.exe`
4. NOTE TO THE GRADER: This program does not work. Please look through my code and provide credit for the work that I did.
