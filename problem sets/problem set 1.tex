\textbf{Problem 2.}\\
A. I bought this bouquet of roses at the deli. Isn't \textit{it} beautiful?\\
Delis are not often described as beautiful.\\
\\
B. The children took out their lunches because \textit{they} were hungry.\\
Lunches are not animate so they cannot be described as hungry.\\
\\
C. The children took out their lunches, but \textit{they} were growing mold.\\
Hygienic children do not grow mold on themselves.\\
\\
D. The scientists are studying three species of fish. \textit{They} are in danger of extinction.\\
Currently, scientists are not in danger of going extinct.\\
\\
E. The scientists are studying three species of fish. \textit{They} have been working for three years.\\
Fish do not work (in the same sense scientists do).\\
\\
F. The scientists are studying three species of fish. \textit{They} were previously unknown.\\
We do not discover previously unknown scientists.\\
\\
G. The scientists are studying three species of fish and how \textit{they} swim.\\
It is more likely that the fish are swimming, not the scientists.\\
\\
H. Before the other guests arrived, Fred murdered George and hid the body under the dining-room table, and then \textit{he} had to be the life and soul of the party, with it there all the time.\\
He cannot refer to George because George is dead.\\
\\
I. Before the other guests arrived, Fred murdered George and hid the body under the dining-room table, and then he had to be the life and soul of the party, with \textit{it} there all the time.\\
Once murdered, a body can be referred to an "it."\\
\\
J. What about the time you cut up tulip bulbs in the hamburgers because you thought \textit{they} were onions?\\
Tulip bulbs are of similar size and shape to tulip bulbs.\\

\textbf{Problem 3.}
\begin{lstlisting}
Lexicon:
"I" -----------> Create Symbol Speaker. Assert Person(Speaker)
                 Denotation = Speaker.
"saw" ---------> Content: See.
"man" ---------> Content: Man.
"telescope" ---> Content: Telescope.

Additional Rules:
Rule 1:
Given: NP ---> Det
           |
           |-> Noun
           |
           |-> PP
    Create new symbol N. Assert Owns(N,Denotation(PP))
Rule 2:
Given: PP ---> Prep
           |
           |-> NP
    Denotation(PP) = Denotation(NP)
Rule 3:
Given: S ---> NP1
          |
          |-> VP ---> Verb
                  |
                  |-> NP2
                  |             
                  |-> PP
    Create new symbol E. Assert Event(E,Verb.Content)
        Assert Actor(E,Denotation(NP1))
        Assert Object(E,Denotation(NP2))
        Assert Instrument(E,Denotation(PP))
